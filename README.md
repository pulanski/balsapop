# Balsapop

A simple project for experimenting with [LALRPOP](https://github.com/lalrpop/lalrpop) and parser generators in general.

Most of the grammar is written within the `src/parser.lalrpop` file. The `src/parser.rs` file is then consequently generated by **LALRPOP** before the project is built during the `cargo build` process. There is a minimal amount of test code in the `src/main.rs` file.

Overall, the project's code is quite messy and is not intended to be used as a reference for anything. It is merely a playground for experimenting with **LALRPOP**.

## Usage

```bash
cargo run --release
```
